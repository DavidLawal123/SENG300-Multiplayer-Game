# 03.02 Authentication Use Case Descriptions #

## AUTH-01: Register account ##

Primary actor: Player
Goal: Create a new account that can be used to log in later.
Preconditions: Player is not currently authenticated.

Trigger: Player selects "Register".

Main success scenario:
System displays registration form.
Player enters required fields (e.g., username/email + password).
System validates input (format rules, required fields).
System checks that the identifier (username/email) is not already taken.
System stores the new account in the User Store Stub (HashMap or file).
System confirms registration (optionally logs the user in).

Postconditions: Account exists in the User Store Stub.

Notes for stub implementation:
HashMap version: in-memory persistence for the run.
File version: load at startup, save after registration.

## AUTH-02: Log in ##

Primary actor: Player
Goal: Authenticate to access protected features.
Preconditions: Player has a registered account in the User Store Stub.

Trigger: Player selects "Log in".

Main success scenario:
System displays login form.
Player enters identifier + password.
System looks up the account in the User Store Stub.
System verifies password.
System creates an authenticated session (or marks user as "logged in").
System navigates to the dashboard / authenticated landing page.

Postconditions: Player is authenticated.

Notes for stub implementation:
Session can be a simple in-memory variable (e.g., currentUser).

## AUTH-03: Reset password ##

Primary actor: Player
Goal: Replace a forgotten password with a new one.
Preconditions: Player is not authenticated (typical) OR is authenticated and wants to change password (optional variant).

Trigger: Player selects "Forgot password" (or "Reset password").

Main success scenario (stub-friendly):
System asks for an identifier (username/email).
System verifies the account exists in the User Store Stub.
System verifies reset authorization using a simplified method (pick one below).
Player enters a new password.
System validates the new password against password rules.
System updates the stored password in the User Store Stub.
System confirms the reset and returns to login.

Postconditions: Stored password is updated.

Choose one reset authorization method (simple for students):
Security question stored in stub (question + answer).

"Email simulation": system displays a one-time code on screen (not realistic, but good for a stubbed environment).

## AUTH-04: Log out ##

Primary actor: Player
Goal: End the authenticated session.
Preconditions: Player is authenticated.

Trigger: Player selects "Log out".

Main success scenario:
System clears the authenticated session (e.g., sets currentUser = null).
System returns to the welcome/login page.

Postconditions: Player is not authenticated.
