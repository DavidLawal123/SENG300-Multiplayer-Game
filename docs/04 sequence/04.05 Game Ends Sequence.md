# Game ends, results stored, return to dashboard #

Description: When the game engine reports a terminal state, the session manager finalizes the session, triggers a stats/leaderboard update (stubbed persistence is acceptable), and publishes a final game state update. The GUI shows the result and then returns to the dashboard.

```uml
@startuml
title Sequence - Game Over -> Update Stats -> Return to Dashboard

actor Player
participant "GUI (Game Page)" as GUI
participant "PlatformCore" as Core
participant "GameSessionManager" as GSM
participant "GameEngine" as Engine
database "Stats Store (stub)" as Stats
participant "EventBus" as Bus

Player -> GUI : submit final move
GUI -> Core : submitMove(sessionId, playerId, move)
Core -> GSM : submitMove(sessionId, playerId, move)

GSM -> Engine : applyMove(...)
Engine --> GSM : newState
GSM -> Engine : evaluateEnd(newState)
Engine --> GSM : gameOver(result)

GSM -> Stats : recordResult(sessionId, result)
Stats --> GSM : ok

GSM -> Bus : publish(GameStateUpdate(status=GAME_OVER, result))
Bus --> Core : deliver(GameStateUpdate)

Core --> GUI : showResult(result)
GUI -> GUI : display win/lose/tie
GUI -> Core : returnToDashboard()
Core --> GUI : openDashboard()
